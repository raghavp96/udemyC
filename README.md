Udemy C

This is a collection of C Programs I've written while taking a Udemy course on C Programming.

I try to be as organized as possible with my folder naming. Since the code is based on a 
video explaining certain concepts, I generally don't have any comments for the code,
as I try to type the code while watching the video.

I've decided to take C because I'm taking CS 5600 - a Computer Systems class, and I believe that
learning C will help me understand how code interacts with the operating system.
